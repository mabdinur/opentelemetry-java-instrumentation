## Contributing

Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome, but before submitting new features
or changes to current functionality [open an
issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/new)
and discuss your ideas or propose the changes you wish to make. After a
resolution is reached a PR can be submitted for review.

In order to build and test this whole repository you need JDK 11+.
Some instrumentations and tests may put constraints on which java versions they support.
See [Executing tests with specific java version](#Executing tests with specific java version) below.

### Plugin structure

OpenTelemetry Auto Instrumentation java agent's jar can logically be divided
into 3 parts.

#### `java-agent` module

This module consists of single class
`io.opentelemetry.auto.bootstrap.AgentBootstrap` which implements [Java
instrumentation
agent](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html).
This class is loaded during application startup by application classloader.
Its sole responsibility is to push agent's classes into JVM's bootstrap
classloader and immediately delegate to
`io.opentelemetry.auto.bootstrap.Agent` (now in the bootstrap class loader)
class from there.

#### `agent-bootstrap` module

This module contains support classes for actual instrumentations to be loaded
later and separately. These classes should be available from all possible
classloaders in the running application. For this reason `java-agent` puts
all these classes into JVM's bootstrap classloader. For the same reason this
module should be as small as possible and have as few dependencies as
possible. Otherwise, there is a risk of accidentally exposing this classes to
the actual application.

#### `agent-tooling` module and `instrumentation` submodules

Contains everything necessary to make instrumentation machinery work,
including integration with [ByteBuddy](https://bytebuddy.net/) and actual
library-specific instrumentations. As these classes depend on many classes
from different libraries, it is paramount to hide all these classes from the
host application. This is achieved in the following way:

- When `java-agent` module builds the final agent, it moves all classes from
`instrumentation` submodules and `agent-tooling` module into a separate
folder inside final jar file, called
`auto-tooling-and-instrumentation.isolated`. In addition, the extension of
all class files is changed from `class` to `classdata`. This ensures that
general classloaders cannot find nor load these classes.
- When `io.opentelemetry.auto.bootstrap.Agent` starts up, it creates an
instance of `io.opentelemetry.auto.bootstrap.AgentClassLoader`, loads an
`io.opentelemetry.auto.tooling.AgentInstaller` from that `AgentClassLoader`
and then passes control on to the `AgentInstaller` (now in the
`AgentClassLoader`). The `AgentInstaller` then installs all of the
instrumentations with the help of ByteBuddy.

The complicated process above ensures that the majority of
auto-instrumentation agent's classes are totally isolated from application
classes, and an instrumented class from arbitrary classloader in JVM can
still access helper classes from bootstrap classloader.

#### Agent jar structure

If you now look inside
`java-agent/build/libs/opentelemetry-auto-<version>.jar`, you will see the
following "clusters" of classes:

- `auto-tooling-and-instrumentation.isolated/` - contains `agent-tooling`
module and `instrumentation` submodules, loaded and isolated inside
`AgentClassLoader`. Including OpenTelemetry SDK (and the built-in exporters when using the `-all` artifact).
- `io/opentelemetry/auto/bootstrap/` - contains `agent-bootstrap` module and
available in bootstrap classloader.
- `io/opentelemetry/auto/shaded/` - contains OpenTelemetry API and its
dependencies. Shaded during creation of `java-agent` jar file by Shadow
Gradle plugin.

### Building

#### Snapshot builds

For developers testing code changes before a release is complete, there are
snapshot builds of the `master` branch. They are available from
[JFrog OSS repository](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/io/opentelemetry/auto/)

#### Building from source

Build using Java 11:

```gradle assemble```

and then you can find the java agent artifact at
`java-agent/build/lib/opentelemetry-auto-<version>-all.jar`.

### Testing

#### Java versions

Open Telemetry Auto Instrumentation's minimal supported version is java 7.
All jar files that we produce, unless noted otherwise, have bytecode
compatible with java 7 runtime. In addition to that we test our code with all
later java versions as well: from 8 to 14.

Some libraries that we auto-instrument may have higher minimal requirements.
In this case we compile and test corresponding auto-instrumentation with
higher java version as required by library. The resulting classes will have
higher bytecode level, but as it matches library's java version, no runtime
problem arise.

#### Instrumentation tests

Executing `./gradlew instrumentation:test` will run tests for all supported
auto-instrumentations using that java version which runs the Gradle build
itself. These tests usually use the minimal supported version of the
instrumented library.

In addition to that each instrumentation has a separate test set called
`latestDepTest`. It was created by [Gradle test sets
plugin](https://github.com/unbroken-dome/gradle-testsets-plugin). It uses the
very same tests as before, but declares a dynamic dependency on the latest
available version of this library. You can run them all by executing
`./gradlew latestDepTest`.

#### Executing tests with specific java version

In order to run tests on a specific java version, just execute `./gradlew
testJava7` (or `testJava11` or `latestDepTestJava14` etc). Then Gradle task
rule will kick in and do the following:

- check, if Gradle already runs on a java with required version
- if not, look for an environment variable named `JAVA_N_HOME`, where `N` is the requested java version
- if Gradle could not found requested java version, then build will fail
- Gradle will now find all corresponding test tasks and configure them to use java executable of the requested version.

This works both for tasks named `test` and `latestDepTest`. But currently
does not work for other custom test tasks, such as those created by test sets
plugin.

### Style guideline

We follow the [Google Java Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Our build will
fail if source code is not formatted according to that style.

The main goal is to avoid extensive reformatting caused by different IDEs having different opinion
about how things should be formatted by establishing.

Running

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

reformats all the files that need reformatting.

Running

```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

runs formatting verify task only.

#### Pre-commit hook

To completely delegate code style formatting to the machine,
there is a pre-commit hook setup to verify formatting before committing.
It can be activated with this command:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

#### Editorconfig

As additional convenience for IntelliJ Idea users, we provide `.editorconfig`
file. Idea will automatically use it to adjust its code formatting settings.
It does not support all required rules, so you still have to run
`googleJavaFormat` from time to time.

### Intellij IDEA

* [Lombok](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok-plugin)

Suggested plugins and settings:

* Editor > Code Style > Java/Groovy > Imports
  * Class count to use import with '*': `9999` (some number sufficiently large that is unlikely to matter)
  * Names count to use static import with '*': `9999`
  * With java use the following import layout (groovy should still use the default) to ensure consistency with google-java-format:
    ![import layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/734411/43430811-28442636-94ae-11e8-86f1-f270ddcba023.png)
